#### A simple, one file script that notifies you on slack when your website is down.

## Configuration

### Step 1 - Get the script

Simply copy paste the script uptimemonitor.py into your server. After you test it add it to cron with your preferred check interval

Example for checks every minute
~~~~
$crontab -e
* * * * * /home/uptimemonitor/uptimemonitor.py > /root/uptimenotifier.log
$service cron restart
$tail -f /root/uptimenotifier.log
~~~~

Note that the script is written in Python3.5.

### Step 2 -  Setup the config variables


URLS_TO_CHECK = ["http://facebook.com",
                 "https://youtube.com:9540"]

#### You have to have a token so you can send messages to a slack channel! Get one here
https://api.slack.com/docs/oauth-test-tokens

You need then to export it as an environmental variable or hardcoded

~~~~
export SLACK_TOKEN = 'your_token_here'
~~~~

SLACK_TOKEN = os.environ.get('SLACK_TOKEN')

#### Where you want to receive your notifications ?

you can get it using list_channels and channel_info or click on the channel name

click on add app or integration and you can view it's id in the webpage redirection (you have to be fast because it redirects it to another page)

~~~~
CHANNEL_ID = "G2LCBCXGF"
~~~~
